This is my first SQL project, where I have made use of Correlated subqueries and CTEs. 
Analysis on cars sales has been conducted in this project where I have identified the Top 5 and bottom 5 customers, Customers Lifetime value, and the top selling type of cars.
The stock to be refilled and prioritised has been identified too along with product performance and products always low on stock.
