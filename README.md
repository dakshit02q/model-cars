This is my first SQL project, where I have made use of Correlated subqueries and CTEs. 
Conducted analysis on sales data of a car dealership where I have identified the Top 5 and bottom 5 customers, Customers Lifetime value, and the top selling class of cars.
The stock to be refilled and prioritised has been identified along with product performance, and the list of products which are always low on stock.
